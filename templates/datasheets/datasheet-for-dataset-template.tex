\section{Datasheets for datasets}

\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010}{Datasheets for Datasets} ``document [the dataset] motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. [They] have the potential to increase transparency and accountability within the machine learning community, mitigate unwanted biases in machine learning systems, facilitate greater reproducibility of machine learning results, and help researchers and practitioners select more appropriate datasets for their chosen tasks.''

The motivation behind the proposal was the electronics industry, where every component has a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics and recommended uses. In machine learning, data is the input for model training. Using the wrong dataset, or using a dataset outside of its original intent, or even not understanding well enough the limitations of a dataset, has dire consequences for the model. However, ``[d]espite the importance of data to machine learning, there is no standardized process for documenting machine learning datasets. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets.''

\dssectionheader{Composition}

\dsquestionex{What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?}{ Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestion{How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?}{ If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features?}{In either case, please provide a description.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Is any information missing from individual instances?}{If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)?}{If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?}{If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?}{If so, please provide a description.}

\dsanswer{
}

\dsquestionex{Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?}{If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.}
